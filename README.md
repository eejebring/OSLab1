# Exercise 1
question:
systemd >> konsole >> fish >> sudo >> sudo >> L1E1.bin >> L1E1.bin(4617)(4618)(4619)

# Exercise 2
1. Execution time ~50 milliseconds
2. the difference is 735 us
3. the difference is 8623 us

# Exercise 3
1. the lenght is ~11957 us when two are working and ~7971 us when three is working .
2. the lenght from start to start on red is 1397101 us
3. the lenght between is 1002899 us
4. the stress lenght is ~204 us. Because it's a big operation that takes a lot of time and processing power semi-intentionally creating a delay time before the clock can be assest.
5. uses 1 core about 45 to 55% of the cpu and the threads use up to 20 % of the cpu.

# Exercise 4
1) the LED:s all blink in sync perhaps green starts a little bit after the others.
2) red: 1618269 us, green: 1614254 us, the blue: 1602207 us

# Exercise 5 
1. nanosleep is more precise than usleep, and clock_nanosleep allows you to choose between different clocks.
2. the difference is 12607 us 50% longer than E2Q3 (whole block took 603987 us)
